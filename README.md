# EPA Terminal
A console app version of the unreleased EPA Terminal made by Decayed Team.

Hello! Welcome to the EPA Terminal. If you aren't familiar with what this is, you may want to join https://discord.gg/hSvvd9ZMtM.
The original EPA Terminal (made by Decayed Team @ https://decayed-team.com) has not been released yet, so this is just a rough idea of what it might look like. Either way I hope you enjoy.

When running the console, please make sure that the zip file it came in has been extracted, otherwise it may not run properly.
